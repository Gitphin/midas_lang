# Midas Lang

A coding language that I wanted to make while learning how to use Rust

I am referencing the book "Crafting Interpreters". It pretty much goes off of a Java implementation so am doing my own loosely based Rust version of it.

This is a work in progress, and I hope to have basic functionality and an installer made soon.
